Open funny games

# Overview
A pair of games inside of an animated graphism for more attractivity

# Description
Our game is a sample of a village which brings together some games. The ones available in our production contains a Runner mode and a Fight mode. Based on three of our marvel childhood heroes, Thor, Ironman and Hulk, we generate an adventure map where they can move freely. And in the case that a case of one of the following game is approached, the game will start automatically.

The first game, Runner, is done with Ironman who have to go the most far away possible through the habilities of the player for this game. He/She will lose if the hero falls into a precipice or blocked by a walk.

The second one is between Hulk and Thor. Its purpose is, for the player who control Hulk, to prevent at least 5 replicas of Thor to arrive on a central square by hitting them. If not, the game is lost.
